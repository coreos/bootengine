When given the correct command line parameters, these generators produce
systemd services to manage a cryptographically verified, read-only mounting of
the usr partition.

The expected cmdline parameters are:
`mount.usr=` which should point /dev/mapper/usr
`verity.usr=` which indicates the underlying physical device
`verity.usrhash=` which supplies the dm-verity root hash
